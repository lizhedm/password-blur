# password-blur

Using password to protect our accounts is very general and widely used for a variety of online applications, such as instant messaging, personal and business e-mail, and online banking. It is still the most common authentication method so far. Shoulder-surfing is a potential risk by direct observation techniques (looking over someone's shoulder) or by recording the individual's authentication session (camera monitoring), to get passwords and other important personal information. When a user enters information using a keyboard, mouse, touch screen or any traditional input device, an observer may be able to acquire the user's passwords. We use a method "PasswordBlur" to protect the users from being observed when they entering their passwords. Perception is the organization, identification, and interpretation of sensory information in order to represent and understand the environment. Users' input characters are blurred and represented. users and others can both see the blurred characters. The other people around users cannot know the exact password but users can recognise the password they input by their perception for characters. What we will focus on is that which type of filters are the best ones and how much rate of the filter is better for users to recognize their inputs and the others can not do that.
